#About Me

Hello there! This is *Shaniah Reece*, A Computer Science student, with a _Human Computer Interaction_ Concentration at Emory University. I hail from Beltsville, Maryland.

Fun fact about me: For as long as I can remember I've been a tech nerd. I got my start into computing with the first piece of technology I owned, a good old fashioned Nintendo video game console where I played Super Mario Bros, Bird Shooting and Donkey Kong. 


## My Brief Bio :D

I am a 2nd year PhD student at Emory with research interests at the intersections of Human Computer Interaction, Physical Computing and Health / Equity. I joined Emory after completing my Bachelor's Degree in Information Sytems from the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.
